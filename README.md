## What (it would be)
**The New Abolitionist**, an online magazine and community with an overarching theme of [abolishing](https://www.hedweb.com/abolitionist-project/) suffering (most probably through technology).

Looking for collaborators of all sorts! but foremost authors, committed to suffering-focused ethics, and web designers.
