(The?) **New Abolitionist** would be an online magazine on transhumanism, effective altruism, and anti-speciesism, with an overarching theme of [abolishing](https://www.hedweb.com/abolitionist-project/) suffering (most probably through technology).

Looking for collaborators of all sorts! but foremost authors, committed to suffering-focused ethics, and web designers.
